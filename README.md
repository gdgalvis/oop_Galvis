# OOP Sandman for German Galvis
## Lyrics to Enter the Sandman

Say your prayers, little one

Don't forget, my son

To include everyone

Tuck you in, warm within

Keep you free from sin

'Til the [sandman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD-E-LDc384), he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

- Exit light

    - Enter night

        - Take my hand

            - We're off to never-never land!
